       }
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <SwipeGesture gestureStyle={styles.swipesGestureContainer} 
            onSwipePerformed={this.onSwipePerformed}>
          <Text>This is react native swipe gesture</Text>
          <Text>Used to detect the user swipes and function accordingly</Text>
        </SwipeGesture>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles= StyleSheet.create({
 container:{
  height:'100%',
  widht:'100%'
 },
 swipesGestureContainer:{

# NOTE 
Avoid using ScollView inside the SwipeGesture Component. Have the ScrollView outside the SwipeGesture Component.
